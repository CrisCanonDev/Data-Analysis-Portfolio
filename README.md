# COMPANIES LAID OFFS ANALYSIS (SQL)

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to clean data of companies' laid-off employees over the past four years. Then, via exploratory data analysis, we analysed various aspects of the laid-offs, we seek to identify trends, and gain a deeper understanding of several companies' laid-offs.

### Data Sources

Laid Offs data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "laidoffs.csv" file, containing detailed information about when a company laid off several employees on a particular date.


### Tools
- SQL Sever - Cleaning data and Exploratory Data Analysis.

### Data Cleaning

In the initial phase, we performed following the tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling duplicates.
3. Data cleaning and formatting through its standarisation.
4. Deletion of any non-relevant column to this analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This stage involved exploring data to answer important questions such as:

- What companies lead the ranking of laid off? per year?
- Which countries laid-offs more employees?
- How many employees have been laid off since the data began to be taken?
